## Challenges: 
I thought this would be a fairly simple game to build, but I just couldn't figure out how to switch between players. Looking back now, I should have not only been more detailed in my pseudo code, but I should have written in detail how I would solve each step of my program (while loop, Player class, etc). Instead I ended up with a lot of spaghetti code :(
## Additional information: 
I tried really hard :)
